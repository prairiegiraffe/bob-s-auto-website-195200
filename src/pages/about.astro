  <CompanyStory 
    headline="From Frustrated Parts Hunter to Trusted Local Auto Expert"
    subheadline="Bob's Auto was born from the same frustration you feel when searching for quality auto parts in Your City"
    content="Our founder Bob started this business after spending countless weekends driving from store to store, searching for the right parts for his family's vehicles. He was tired of getting sold inferior parts that failed within months, dealing with staff who couldn't answer basic compatibility questions, and watching his neighbors get overcharged for simple maintenance items. What began as a personal mission to find reliable parts suppliers has grown into Your City's most trusted automotive parts resource. Today, we've built relationships with quality manufacturers and local mechanics that took years to develop, saving our customers the time and frustration we once experienced ourselves. We know exactly which parts hold up in our local climate conditions and which suppliers consistently deliver what they promise."
