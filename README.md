## ðŸ“¸ Image Optimization

This project uses Astro's built-in `astro:assets` for automatic image optimization:
- WebP conversion with fallbacks
- Responsive image generation  
- Automatic layout shift prevention
- Lazy loading by default

To use optimized images in your components:
```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import heroImage from '../assets/images/hero/main-hero.jpg';
---
<Image src={heroImage} alt="Description" width={800} height={400} />
```
