    subheadline="Every day you drive with incorrect or failing parts puts your vehicle at risk of catastrophic breakdowns that could strand you or require expensive emergency repairs"
    content="When you can't find the right auto parts or settle for cheap knockoffs, you're gambling with your vehicle's reliability and your safety. That minor engine noise could turn into a seized motor. Those worn brake pads you've been putting off could fail when you need them most. The wrong transmission fluid could destroy your entire transmission system. Vehicle owners in Your City who continue shopping at parts stores that don't have what they need often end up with mismatched components that cause cascading failures throughout their vehicle systems. Without expert guidance, you risk buying parts that seem right but actually accelerate wear on other components, leading to repair bills that cost three to five times more than getting the correct parts from the start."

    subheadline="Stop wasting your weekends searching for the right parts while your car sits broken in the driveway"
    content="You know the frustration all too well. Your car breaks down on a Tuesday, and by Saturday you've visited AutoZone, O'Reilly's, and NAPA - only to discover each store has a different opinion on what part you need, none of them have it in stock, and you're no closer to getting back on the road. Meanwhile, you're losing money on rideshares, borrowing cars from family, and that sinking feeling grows that you're about to get ripped off by someone who thinks you don't know anything about cars. The technical jargon, the conflicting advice, the wrong parts that don't fit - it shouldn't be this complicated to fix your vehicle."
